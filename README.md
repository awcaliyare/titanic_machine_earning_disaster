## **Introduction**

The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset for data science and machine learning, providing details about passengers such as their age, gender, ticket class, and survival status. The project involves:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Investigating survival trends based on features like gender, class, and fare.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features such as family size and fare bins to improve model performance.  
- **Machine Learning Modeling:** Comparing multiple models to identify the best approach for survival prediction.  
- **Insights and Recommendations:** Drawing actionable conclusions to improve evacuation protocols during emergencies.

## **Key Insights**

1. **Passenger Class:**  
   - **First-class passengers** had the highest survival rate (**62.96%**), while **Third-class passengers** had the lowest (**24.24%**).  
   - **Takeaway:** Socio-economic status significantly influenced survival chances.

2. **Gender:**  
   - Females had a **74.20%** survival rate compared to **18.89%** for males, reflecting the "women and children first" policy.  

3. **Family Size:**  
   - Small families (2â€“4 members) had the highest survival rate (**72.41%**), while solo travelers and large families (5+ members) faced lower survival chances.  

4. **Fare:**  
   - Higher fare bins were strongly associated with higher survival rates, with **100% survival** in the highest fare bin.

5. **Age:**  
   - Children (0â€“10 years) had a **61.29%** survival rate, while seniors (70+ years) had the lowest survival rate (**14.29%**).

## **Conclusions and Recommendations**

### **Key Recommendations:**
1. **Evacuation Protocols:**  
   - Develop class-agnostic lifeboat allocation policies to ensure equitable access.  
   - Prioritize vulnerable groups like children, seniors, and large families.  

2. **Model Selection for Deployment:**  
   - Use **Logistic Regression** for simplicity and interpretability.  
   - Consider **XGBoost** for more complex use cases requiring better performance on interactions.

3. **Feature Engineering:**  
   - Investigate interactions (e.g., **Pclass Ã— Fare**, **Age Ã— Gender**) to further improve model performance.
