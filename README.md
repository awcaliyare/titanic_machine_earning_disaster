# Titanic Dataset Analysis ðŸš¢

## **Overview**

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset, uncovering survival patterns, demographic insights, and actionable recommendations. It also includes a performance comparison of several machine learning models to predict passenger survival. The findings aim to inform equitable resource allocation during crises and demonstrate predictive modeling techniques. ðŸŒŠðŸ“Š


## **Key Insights**

### **1. Survival by Passenger Class**
- **First-class passengers** had the highest survival rate (**62.96%**), while **Third-class passengers** fared the worst (**24.24%**).  
- **Visual:**  
  - Bar chart: Survival rates by class.
  - Pie chart: Proportion of passengers in each class.


### **2. Survival by Gender**
- **Females:** Survival rate of **74.20%**.  
- **Males:** Survival rate of **18.89%**.

### **5. Socio-Economic Influence**
- **Fare:** Higher fares strongly correlated with survival (**100% for top fare bins**).  
- **Visual:**  
  - Scatter plot: Survival vs. fare.  


### **6. Embarkation Port**
- **Cherbourg (C):** Highest survival rate (**55.36%**).  
- **Southampton (S):** Lowest survival (**33.7%**).  
- **Visual:**  
  - Bar chart: Survival rates by embarkation port.
